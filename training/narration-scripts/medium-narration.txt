You have ideas. Good ones. But somewhere between your phone, your laptop, your inbox, and that spreadsheet nobody updates... they die. Not because they're bad. Because your environment kills them.
SpeakUp is a workflow pattern that fixes this. Ideation happens anywhere—your phone, a conversation, a whiteboard. Execution happens in one place—an IDE with AI assistance. Everything gets captured automatically to a system of record. No manual logging. No lost context. No excuses.
One person. 40+ commits. A working protocol implementation, security verification, this briefing deck, and full documentation. Not a team. One person. The constraint isn't capability. It's environment.
Everything is open source. The briefing, the code, the verification evidence. Link in the description. Go see for yourself.
Let's break down what's actually killing your productivity.
These aren't character flaws. They're environmental problems. And environmental problems have environmental solutions.
The SpeakUp workflow has two active phases and one passive phase.
The key insight: you can jump between ideation and execution at any time. They're not sequential phases. They're modes of work.
Now, if you work in government or defense, you're already thinking about objections.
'We can't use cloud AI.' Fine. Use local models.
'We can't use GitHub.' Fine. Use GitLab or self-host.
'We have classification requirements.' Fine. The workflow supports proper markings.
The SpeakUp repository itself contains no PII, no CUI, no classified information. Verified by automated scans. You can review it without relaxing any rules.
Your implementation choices—where AI runs, where code lives, what devices you use—those are yours. The pattern is agnostic.
Here's the core point: with the right environment, one person can do the work of an entire team.
Not by working harder. By removing friction. By letting AI handle the mechanical parts. By capturing knowledge automatically instead of hoping someone writes it down.
This isn't about replacing people. It's about multiplying them.
Here's what to do next:
One—review the briefing deck. It's designed to be read without a presenter.
Two—identify a pilot area. Something small where you can test the pattern.
Three—set up the environment. Repository, IDE, AI access.
Four—iterate. Ideation, execution, review. Let the system of record build itself.
Everything you need is in the repository. Link in the description.
