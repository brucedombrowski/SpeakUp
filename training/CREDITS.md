# SpeakUp Training Materials - Credits

## Background Music

The background music in SpeakUp training videos is procedurally generated using `generate-music.py`. All generated music is original work owned by the project.

### Generation Tool
- **Script**: `generate-music.py`
- **Libraries**: midiutil (MIDI generation), fluidsynth (synthesis)
- **License**: MIT (same as project)

### Future Vision: Dubstep Generation
The music generation capability is intended to eventually support dubstep/EDM production with specified audio clips via CLI. This would enable:
- Programmatic beat creation
- Integration of voice samples
- Automated remixing capabilities

## License Inquiries

### Alan Watts Lectures (2024-12-23)

**Status**: NOT authorized for use in SpeakUp videos

**Background**: Project creator legally purchased complete Alan Watts lecture collection from alanwatts.org for personal use.

**License research findings** (per https://alanwatts.org/licensing):
- Lectures remain under copyright (not public domain until ~2044)
- Personal/educational non-monetized use: Allowed
- YouTube/commercial use: Requires 50/50 revenue share license agreement
- Fair use for short clips: Legally ambiguous, not recommended without license

## In Memoriam: Luke A. Dombrowski (1989-2024)

This project is dedicated to the memory of **Luke A. Dombrowski**, aka **Fuchinluke**, a talented dubstep DJ and producer, and beloved brother of the project creator.

Luke's passion for electronic music and creative production continues to inspire this work. His music lives on:

- **SoundCloud**: [soundcloud.com/fuchinluke](https://soundcloud.com/fuchinluke)
- **Qobuz**: [Party Time by Fuchinluke](https://www.qobuz.com/gb-en/album/party-time-fuchinluke/tvw2k23k1u5cb)

> "The constraint isn't capability. It's environment."
>
> Luke understood this. He made music wherever he was—bedroom studios, borrowed equipment, whatever it took. The tools didn't matter. The drive did.

### Easter Eggs

Hidden throughout SpeakUp training materials are subtle tributes to Fuchinluke:
- Audio waveform visualizations reference dubstep aesthetic
- Tempo choices in generated music nod to EDM conventions
- The "one person, unlimited capability" message reflects Luke's DIY ethos

If you're watching and you knew Luke—drop the bass one more time.
