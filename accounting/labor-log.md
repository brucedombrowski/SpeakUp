## Logging Guidelines

This log supplements the git-derived labor estimates in `calculate-costs.sh` for:
- Review/feedback time that doesn't produce commits
- Meetings and discussions
- Research and planning that doesn't result in artifacts
- Any work that falls outside normal commit patterns

**Format**: Date, activity description, duration, context notes
